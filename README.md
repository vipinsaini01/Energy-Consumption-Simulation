# Energy-Consumption-Simulation
# Energy Consumption Simulation 

This project simulates building energy usage data and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors that impact energy consumption.

# Features
- Generates synthetic data for building characteristics and energy usage
- Explores relationships between features and energy consumption
- Useful for sustainability-focused analytics and ML modeling

# Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- matplotlib, seaborn

# Dataset Columns
- `BuildingSize` (sq ft)
- `InsulationLevel`
- `WeatherImpact`
- `HVACEfficiency`
- `EnergyConsumption` (target)

## Files
- `building_energy_consumption.ipynb`: Notebook with data generation + EDA
- `energy_data.csv`: Generated dataset (optional)

# How to Use
1. Run the notebook to generate synthetic data
2. Perform EDA to observe patterns
3. Use it for regression practice or modeling
